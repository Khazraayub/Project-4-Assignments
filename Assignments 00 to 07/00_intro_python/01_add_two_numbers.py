# Problem Statement
# Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum. The program should perform the following tasks:

# Prompt the user to enter the first number.

# Read the input and convert it to an integer.

# Prompt the user to enter the second number.

# Read the input and convert it to an integer.

# Calculate the sum of the two numbers.

# Print the total sum with an appropriate message.

# The provided solution demonstrates a working implementation of this problem, where the main() function guides the user through the process of entering two numbers and displays their sum.




def main():
    # Prompt the user to enter the first number
    first_number = int(input("Enter the first number: "))

    # Prompt the user to enter the second number
    second_number = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Calculate the sum
    total = first_number + second_number

    # Print the result
    print("The sum is:", total)

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
